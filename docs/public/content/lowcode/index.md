## Doing the right things vs doing things right

Modern low-code platforms provide a significant upgrade over traditional Excel and VBA usage in the business environment. They offer a more efficient and scalable way to handle data and build applications, facilitating collaboration through real-time, multi-user access which Excel lacks.
